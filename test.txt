 Develop a Python script or application to scrape car image and car their metadata(model_year,mileage,price...) from
 www.cars.com, categorize them based on model categories, store them in an organized file
 system, and create a CSV file in each category folder containing detailed metadata of the car
 . This project will explore both serial and multithreaded programming approaches.

 Project Description
 Inputs
 1. Website URL: The primary input will be the URL to www.cars.com,

 2. Category(bmw,jeep,benz...):
 categories and their related metadata present on the website.
 Outputs
 1. Folder Structure: Create a main directory with subdirectories for each car
 category. Each category's folder will store vector graphics files and a CSV file.
 2. Stored car photo: Download and store car photo in their respective
 category folders.
 3. CSVFiles: Generate a CSV file in each category folder containing detailed information
 for each car, including 'model_year', 'mileage', 'price', 'price_drop', 'dealer_rating', and other
 relevant metadata.
 4. Summary Report: A chart summarizing the number of cars downloaded per
 category.
 Phases
 1. Phase 1: Serial Implementation
 ○ Implement web scraping, categorization, file storage, and CSV file generation
 using a serial approach.
 ○ Document the performance in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
 2. Phase 2: Multithreaded Implementation
 ○ Modify the script to perform the same tasks using multithreading.
 ○ Analyze and compare the performance with the serial approach.
